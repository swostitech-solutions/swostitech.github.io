          <!-- <h2> <i class="fa-brands fa-searchengin"></i> SEO services.</h2>
        <p>When you hear someone say white-hat SEO, that means the SEO practices that are in-line with the terms and conditions of the major search engines, including Google. White-hat SEO improves your search engine ranking on the SERPs while regulating the integrity of your website with the search engine’s terms of service. 
         <br><b>1. White-hat SEO</b> practices are the best way to create a successful website. Here are a few white-SEO practices that you must follow strictly:
          <br>•	Use keyword-rich, descriptive meta-tags
          <br>•	Provide quality services and content to the website’s visitors
          <br>•	Make your website easy to navigate  
          <br><b>2. Black-Hat SEO</b>
         <br> Black-hat SEO exploits weaknesses in Google's search algorithm to rank higher in its search results. Spammy or paid link-building strategies, keyword stuffing, cloaking, etc., are used to get ahead in the search engine results. These practices give instant results, but they can impact your website negatively if detected by Google. Hence, it is advised to avoid black hat SEO. 
          
          <br><b>3. Gray-Hat SEO</b>
         <br> It’s an SEO practice that’s riskier than white-hat SEO. That’s because the gray-hat SEO practices belong neither to the white-hat nor black-hat category as the terms and conditions regarding the issue are unclear. However, using gray-hat SEO practices will not result in site ban from search engines. In simpler terms, the material or content that you publish in accordance with the gray-hat SEO remains ill-defined. Knowing the gray-hat SEO practices can save your website from losing traffic as you will be well-aware of the negative consequences, which will help you adopt fair practices.

    <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Researchers at MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms are working on an ambitious project, designing robots that effectively self-assemble. The team admits that the goal of an autonomous self-building robot is still “years away,” but the work has thus far demonstrated positive results.

      At the system’s center are voxels (a term borrowed from computer graphics), which carry power and data that can be shared between pieces. The pieces form the foundation of the robot, grabbing and attaching additional voxels before moving across the grid for further assembly.
      
      The researchers note in an associated paper published in Nature, “Our approach challenges the convention that larger constructions need larger machines to build them, and could be applied in areas that today either require substantial capital investments for fixed infrastructure or are altogether unfeasible.”</p>
        <br>Developing the proper level of intelligence for these systems is a big hurdle. Among other things, the robots need to determine how and where to build, when to begin building a new robot and just generally how to avoid bumping into each other in the process.

        “When we’re building these structures, you have to build in intelligence,” the paper’s coauthor, Neil Gershenfeld, says in a release. “[W]hat emerged was the idea of structural electronics — of making voxels that transmit power and data as well as force.”
        
        Hardware issues remain, as well. The team is currently working on building stronger connectors to keep the voxels together.
